# UEBA_Behavioral_Analytics_Security
User and entity behavior analytics (UEBA), or user behavior analytics (UBA), is a type of cybersecurity solution or feature that discovers threats by identifying activity that deviates from a normal baseline.

**Scope:**
Senthil had selected the research topic “User and Entity Behavioral Analytics for Cyber Security based on Deep Learning Methodologies”. In a nut shell, the advancement of hacking methods, continually increasing cyber crimes and emerging heterogeneous environment of IOT, BYOD, WorkFromHome and other factors increases the complexity and possible failures of the traditional security control mechanisms. Hence, Senthil proposing a solution of behavioral analytics with deep learning algorithms for the early detection of hackers, malicious activities and potential compromise well in advance.
